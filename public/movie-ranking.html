        <h3>The Parsuit of Happyness</h3>
        <p>The story, of the struggles of one, trying to do something,
             but not knowing what to do, in order to feed his family,
             and gain the selfworth that one needs and deserves.
             The portrial of the protagonist by Will Smith adds to the
             beauty of the movie.

            Engineer one day in near future and trying to ideolising
            'Rancho'. As time passed, loved to movie more understaing
            'Raju' more, as a engineering student and lastly realising
            the pov "Ga-d-dha" as after graduating from the engineering

        <h3>PK</h3>
        <p>This movie is so enjoyable yet so profound.
            A comedy movie trying to convey the profound truths
            peoples believes and the way it can be used to manipulate
            one's thoughts, thus one's life.
